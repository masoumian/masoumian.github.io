Hi! I'm Alireza, a research assistant at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [Csaba Szepesvári](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/). I obtained my MSc's in computing science supervised by [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/) at University of Alberta.  I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

I am interested in the theory of sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and more specifically in making connections between game-theoretic ideas and reinforcement learning theory. This implies working in the intersection of RL theory, Game Theory, and Online Learning. I'm also a fan of Statistical Learning, and Mechanism Design.
