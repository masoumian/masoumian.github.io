I'm a second-year master's student in computing science at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/). I obtained my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (minor degree) from Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

I work in the intersection of Game Theory and RL theory. I'm also a fan of online decision-making (preferably under uncertainty and by multiple agents!), mechanism design, and statistical learning.
