Hi! I'm Alireza, a research assistant at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [Csaba Szepesv√°ri](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/). I obtained my MSc's in computing science supervised by [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/) at University of Alberta.  I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

I am interested in the theory of sequential decision-making under uncertainty and (preferably!) in multi-agent settings. This implies working in the intersection of RL theory, Game Theory, and Online Learning. Learning in Games and Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) are close keywords. I'm also a fan of Mechanism Design, and Statistical Learning.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
