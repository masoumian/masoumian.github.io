Hi! I'm Alireza, a second-year master's student in computing science at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/). I obtained my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (minor degree) from Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

I am interested in sequential decision-making under uncertainty and (preferably!) by multiple agents. This implies working in the intersection of Game Theory and RL theory. Learning in Games and Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) are close keywords. I'm also a fan of mechanism design, and statistical learning.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
