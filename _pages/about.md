Hi! I'm Alireza, a second-year master's student in computing science at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/). I obtained my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (minor degree) from Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

I work in the intersection of Game Theory and RL theory. I'm also a fan of online decision-making (preferably under uncertainty and by multiple agents!), mechanism design, and statistical learning.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
